# spotify-explore-playlist
Using logistic regression to explore new music, I discovered 19 new songs outside the sphere of my normal listening.

## Objective

As someone who really enjoys exploring music I find myself often finding new artists similar to what I enjoy thanks to Spotify's recommendation. The problem however is these artists revolve around a similar genre. I thought it would be an interesting experiment to see if I could explore music outside of my normal sphere of listening which I still might like based on current preferences. This would not only allow me to let me find new artists, but find new genres which I might not otherwise explore.

## Method

I used Python to access Spotify's API for working with my personal music preferences and playlist creation. I used Jupyter Lab to explore the various features of the tracks, perform statistical tests, and run the linear regression.
